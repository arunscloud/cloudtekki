# Observations from Fortune XX customers

I have had the opportunity to work with a lot of big Enterprises and ALMOST everyone thinks that they have some fundamental issue. Based on my observation, you'll be glad to hear that no one is perfect! 

Here is my attempt at capturing common problems that occur within IT teams from the biggest to the smallest, from the most organized to the most chaotic...

## 1. When you don't have an UAT

You know you are doing it wrong when you claim you don't have time for testing in UAT

## 2. When all your projects are due in a week

You know you are doing it wrong when you and your team are always in a state of crisis management or scurrying around like ants either without direction or attempting to look busy

## 3. When you try to bend the Product around what are clearly People problems

When one team won't talk to the other, they always want the Product that they are using to accommodate for the gap in people relationship

## 4. When your team is full of contractors

You are not fostering or cultivating ownership or thought leadership. 

## 5. When you do more of the talking that your team

When you walk into the room, does the room go silent? 


## 6. When your team relies on the vendor to negotiate b/w your teams

Teams develop these silos and ego issues mainly due to remote culture these days

## 7. When you continue asking for product road maps

Where is your vision? Where is your roadmap? 

## 8. No one on your team is certified

i mean... come on now!
