I'm in my 3rd month of my Product Management career and as I get comfortable with the role, I've realized that in this role I feel like I'm thriving, adding value and making the most impact! These days, I am excited to get out of bed and I have trouble sleeping because I'm already excited about what I can accomplish the next day! 

As I look back at my Journey to be a well rounded Product Manager, I realize that it started when I was a 2 years into my fresh out of college developer role. I enjoyed coding and it felt like I was creating music or art! While I wasn't the best developer, I enjoyed solving problems through code and could get lost doing it for hours. However by the 2nd year, I had started yearning for more and wanted to understand more about the Business problems that I was solving (the cx) and if there were better ways to address their problems. To transition, I did my Masters in Information System with the goal of becoming a Business Analyst of some kind (a role that I think is comparable in parts to Product Management). I thought I'll get to do this through the "Consultant" experience that I was going to get at AirWatch (later acquired by VMware). This decision gave me the pleasure of working closely with Customers, understanding what their perspectives on a certain topic and also a front row seat to observing their processes. A great experience overall... 

> NOTE: The only caveat to taking this approach of seeking out different experiences in one's career is that I had very minimal control over how long those experiences would be. I was a developer for one year too many. I planned to be in the field for 4 years and it took me 7 years instead. The reasons for these varied ranges from personal issues to lack of motivation to political issues. 

For this blog post, I wanted to summarize my most valuable learnings over the seven years of working closely with Customers in the hopes that it will help folks with their Customer relationship management! 

## Topic 1: Trust 
My entire customer experience can be summed up as - "Working with the top tier Customers who need strategic, tactical and technical guidance on utilizing VMware Products effectively and achieving their Business Objectives!". Over the years I'd worked with around 20 of the Fortune 500 Companies and I ensured that I left a lasting impression by providing great Customer Service. I empathized with my Customers and viewed theirs problems as if they were my own. I would then move mountains and earth to get them where they needed to be! With every one of my Customer, I had a thought process on how to gain their trust and I managed to deliver the results they needed by being their trusted advisor. Let's explore what that means... 

### Who is a trusted advisor? 

There are many roles that explicitly contain the word "trusted advisor" in their Job Description but here are my thoughts on the top few where I consider trust is crucial

> NOTE: Trust is crucial in any role and here I'm summarizing the part Trust plays when working with a Customer. 

| Function   |   Description   | Technical Knowledge | Relationship | Trust | 
|:--------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Professional Services (TAM, Consultant) | Customer paid resource who helps with hands-on services including Installing, Configuring or Managing aspects of a Technical Solution | High | Short Term (mostly) | Trusted Implicitly; Mistakes are costly and erodes trust | 
| Support (Support Engineer) | The go to set of resources that help when a Technology Solution is broken | High | Medium Term (mostly) | Trusted Implicitly; Mistakes are costly and erodes trust | 
| Customer Success (Support Managers)| Resources that help the Customer maximize their return on Investment with a particular Vendor | Medium (excluding Engineers) | Long Term (mostly) | Considered Neutral and it's safe to build trust over time | 
| Sales (Sales Representatives) | Resources that help the Customer map Business problems to Outcomes which can be achieved through the Company they represent | Low (excluding Engineers) |  Long Term (definitely) | Often starts on the back foot and needs to slowly build trust to make any Impact | 


### What is trust?

The way I've understood **Trust** through the many years of working closely with Customers as their trusted advisor and something I've practiced can be expressed as  

$$Trust = (Honesty + Empathy) * Consistency$$

Simply put, to earn trust in any capacity (Professional and Personal) you have to be honest and empathetic. The more consistent you are, the more Trust you tend to build.

As I reflect back on my experiences, here are some additional thoughts
- A Trusted Advisor provides an unbiased and honest viewpoint about any given situation and ensure everyone involved has clarity.. PRO TIP: use data to build credibility as needed
- A Trusted Advisor aims to balance Company direction and Customer needs. When a Customer needs something, they evaluate the ask and after completing the necessary due diligence on all possible options, they ensure they are taking all the steps to help obtain the needed results.
- As a Trusted Advisor, you always evaluate every possible options with the Customer which ensures transparency and builds credibility. 

In addition to my thoughts above, I wanted to also summarize Trust as defined by the [The Trust Equation](https://trustedadvisor.com/why-trust-matters/understanding-trust/understanding-the-trust-equation) 

$$Trust = \frac{Credibility + Reliability + Empathy}{Self Orientation}$$

#### Credibility

has to do with the words we speak. In a sentence we might say, “I can trust what she says about intellectual property; she’s very credible on the subject.”

#### Reliability

has to do with actions. We might say, “If he says he’ll deliver the product tomorrow, I trust him, because he’s dependable.”

#### Intimacy

refers to the safety or security that we feel when entrusting someone with something. We might say, “I can trust her with that information; she’s never violated my confidentiality before, and she would never embarrass me.”

#### Self-orientation

refers to the person’s focus. In particular, whether the person’s focus is primarily on him or herself, or on the other person. We might say, “I can’t trust him on this deal — I don’t think he cares enough about me, he’s focused on what he gets out of it.” Or more commonly, “I don’t trust him — I think he’s too concerned about how he’s appearing, so he’s not really paying attention.”

With these thoughts, I hope I've given you some insight into building, earning and retaining Trust with your Customers.

## Topic 2: How do you know you are doing it wrong?

A decade of working with Customers gave me a front row seat to various IT teams - those that consider themselves small and with those that know they are a big deal. I've had plenty of time to observe what works well and what doesn't work well within a team. So this second topic that I'm going to cover might be a little controversial and is a critical take on certain IT patterns that I've observed! 

> NOTE: Now I understand classifying something as a binary (wrong vs right) could overlook different perspectives, opinions and facts..
> :warning: SPOILER ALERT! ALMOST everyone thinks/knows that they have some issue (organizational silos, lack expertise, lack leadership, lack discipline or lack organization skills). Based on my observation, you'll be glad to hear that no one is perfect! 

Here is my attempt at capturing some common problems that occur within IT teams ranging from the biggest to the smallest, from the most organized to the most chaotic... Additionally, I've provided some thoughts on how to address these challenges below. 

### Testing Discipline

Chances are that your team is understaffed, overworked.. or plain lazy! 

#### SYMPTOMS

{{<image src="/img/misc/time-cx/overworked.gif" width="100px" caption="Bad Mood" class="imageright">}} 

Do you often catch yourself saying  
- "We don't have an UAT, we do our testing in our PROD environment"
- "We don't have time for testing"
- "It will take a long time to set up a test environment"

#### SOLUTION

**As a Manager**, understand how your teams are sized and their workload. For a given Software and how critical it is to your business, do you have enough resources to install best practices in Change Management

**As an individual contributor** running operations and bearing the responsibility of providing the best experience for your Customers, a lot is riding on your choices! An extra step of validating the change in UAT should only give you the reassurance needed to complete the change in Production. If you don't see this happening in your Organization, time to raise the RED flag. Feel free to refer back to this post as a means for building justification :thumbsup: 


### Weak Leader

Chances are that you are/have a weak leader. 

#### SYMPTOMS

Do you see you or your team try to fix what are clearly People problems through Software features? Do you find the room going silent when you walk into a room filled with your team? 

{{<image src="/img/misc/time-cx/nottheone.jpg" width="100px" caption="Bad Mood" class="imageright">}} 

#### SOLUTION

**As a Manager**, This is a major problem brewing in your ranks. This may not be very prevalent or apparent but beyond what is tolerable Office Politics, when your team members are not partnering with other teams to achieve an outcome, it is time for a team building exercise! It is also critical that you earn the trust of your team. 

**As an individual contributor**, If you feel mentally drained or always on the defensive when talking to a certain team member, you are probably at fault as well. It is time for an introspection and try to understand how you can improve your side of the equation - maybe you need more research to backup your ask or maybe you need to change your approach with this individual. If nothing works, what can i say.. some people just wake up on the wrong side of the bed...everyday! :persevere:


### No Culture

Chances are that your team lacks a culture or simply nothing that ties them together towards accomplishing a single vision and objective! 

#### SYMPTOMS

Do you find that no one on your team is taking initiatives and lacks self motivation? Do you find yourself with/in a team full of contractors? 

#### SOLUTION

**As a Manager**, ensure you are cultivating ownership or fostering thought leadership amidst your team. Rewarding the right actions is often a great way to reinforce positive behavior. Finding and tapping into the the inherent motivation of individuals on your team and turning that into positive momentum is the crucial skill any manager needs to obtain! 

**As an individual contributor**, if you find yourself in this position and if you are a high agency individual, you should be able to single handedly influence a positive energy amidst the team. If you aren't being recognized or valued for making any headway to improve the team's culture, that's your cue to start looking for a better team to work with. 


### Lack of Collaboration

Chances are that you have a divided team in your hands. Teams develop these silos for a number of reasons ranging for ego, politics, lack of clarity etc. 

#### SYMPTOMS

Do you do more of the talking that your team in a team meeting? Do you find it difficult to have your team engaging in a conversation? Do you sometimes have your Vendor trying to broker or negotiate a discussion within your teams? 

#### SOLUTION

**As a Manager**, ensure that
- you are enabling your teams to stay connected in these primarily remote first culture these days and ensure there are no huge egos within the team
- you are setting clear goals (strategic and tactical) and socializing that amongst the team so they can work in unison to achieve it
- that there are clear career progression paths established so you don't have a few individuals pitting against each other and causing a division amongst the team

**As an individual contributor**, ensure you are a team player first and initiating conversations that squash confusion. The biggest problem that we have is mostly around Collaboration. Bringing people together is difficult at first, starts making sense with the second attempt and is recognized as the most critical element for success in every subsequent attempts. 

### Lack of Vision

Chances are that you don't have a vision for your Team. Chances are that you are not causing the change but you are reacting to those changes.

#### SYMPTOMS

Do you often rely on your Vendor's road map to get a sense for where you should be focussing on for your Company? Do you find your team are often firefighting more than leading projects that could positively impact Business Outcomes? Do you see yourself copying others? Do you find your team has difficulty in anticipating change and being able to respond as quickly as the business needs? Do you find you or your team always running from one project to another not having the time to focus or strategize?

#### SOLUTION

Stay aware of your technology domain to get a sense for where you and your industry will be in 6 months, 1 year and 5 years. Even as a draft, write down your idea of the direction you need to take. Start talking about your road maps to your Vendor and be open to identifying areas of improvements. 

### Lack of Expertise 

Chances are that your team is not adequately certified to manage the product for day 2 operations! 

#### SYMPTOMS

Do you often need Professional Services to do anything with a Product? When something bad happens with a Product, do you scramble to make a call to the Vendor first? Do you feel like your organization is behind the curve on IT innovations within your Industry? 

#### SOLUTION

**As a Manager**, encourage your team members to get Certified on the Products that are considered Business critical. If your budget is limited, plan on a rotational program to get your team certified in batches so at least a few members of your team are certified any given year. 

**As an individual contributor**, the industry loves those that are experts and your career growth depends on your proficiency in the area you claim to work on. There are a number of ways to be an expert on Technology domain and keeping yourselves relevant. Some ideas are 
- Subscribing to blogs, Vendor knowledge base and Experts in the domain
- Hands on Labs or maintaining your own Lab
- Staying connected with Peers in the Technology domain
