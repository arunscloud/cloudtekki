    <description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;ve talked about why everyone needs a homelab in my medium article but never had the courage to submit my homelab to the community homelab list maintained by William Lam Follow. Mainly because I wasn&rsquo;t sure how my lab would stack up against everyone elses' submission. With my latest post covering my experience enabling Tanzu with vSphere in my homelab, I feel like I&rsquo;ve gone through the checklist of best practices and I&rsquo;m proud of my minimalist(if i can say so myself) homelab setup!]]></description>

As someone who has primarily worked on the application/software layer, I have been oblivious to the underlying infrastructure that made it all possible.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Reflecting on 2020 Now no matter where you are located geographically or how old you are, I&rsquo;m going to take a wild guess and assume that we can agree how brutal 2020 was. Personally looking back, the year 2020 has been crazy, challenging and definitely packed a punch.. A year with mixed fortunes, 2020 was a year that I&rsquo;ve never imagined in my lifetime.
